## WeatherPY

Utilizing the citipy Python library, and Open Weather Map API,
create a representative model of weather across cities.  

### ***Latitude vs. Temperature***
Show how temperature is varied from cities depending on where they are located.  

### The closer a city is to the equator the warmer that city is.

## __Northern Hemisphere__

## __Southern Hemiphere__

### ***Lat vs. Wind Speed***
Show if there is an difference in Wind Speed depending on how close a city is to the equator.

### The results show that the closer you are to the equator the less wind you will experience.

### ***Latitude cs Cloudiness***
Show how close a city is to the equator is affected by the cloudiness.

### The results reveal that in the Southern Hemisphere, the closer you are to the equator you are the cloudier it is. In the Norther Hempisphere, the farther you are from the equator cloudier it is.

### ***Latitude vs Humidity***
Show how the latitude of a city affects Humidity

## The results reveal that in the Southern Hemisphere, the closer you get to the equator the more humid it is, as opposed to the northern hemisphere, where the farther away from the equator you are the more humid it is.

## VacationPY
Utilizing a given csv of cities and weather information, and Geoapify, come up with a set of conditions of ideal weather conditions to map out a vacation destination.  Plot your specific city conditionals and find the nearest hotels to the given Latitude and Longitude of those cities.
